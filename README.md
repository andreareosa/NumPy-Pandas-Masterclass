# NumPy & Pandas Masterclass

The objetive of this repository is to master the essentials of NumPy and Pandas, two of Python's most powerful data packages


## NumPy

**NumPy** also known as Numerical Python is an open-source library that is the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and forms the foundation of other libraries like Pandas as Pandas DataFrames are built on NumPy arrays and can leverage NumPy functions.

## Pandas

**Pandas** is Pythonâ€™s most widely used library for data analysis, and contains functions for accessing, aggregating, joining, and analyzing data. 
Its data structure, the DataFrame, is analogous to SQL tables or Excel worksheets


### 1 - Pandas Series

Pandas Series is the equivalent of a column of data. In this section we will cover their basic properties, creation, manipulation and useful functions.
Pandas series are really just numpy arrays with additional features layered into them to make them easier to work with.
